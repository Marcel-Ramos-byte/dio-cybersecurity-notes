# Reconnaissance

Reconnaissance is the initial phase of a cybersecurity assessment where information about a target system is collected.

## Passive Reconnaissance

Passive techniques gather information without directly interacting with the target.

Examples:

* Search engines
* Public datasets
* Metadata analysis
* Certificate transparency logs

## Active Reconnaissance

Active techniques involve interacting with the target infrastructure.

Examples:

* Port scanning
* Service enumeration
* DNS interrogation

## Common Tools (Study Only)

* Nmap
* Whois
* DNS tools
* Web fingerprinting utilities

## Always remember that even if you are only studying it is not allowed to do any kind of technique without a formal authorization, do you labs on your own private devices and network

These tools must always be used responsibly and only against authorized systems.
