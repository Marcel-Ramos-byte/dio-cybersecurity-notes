# Incident Response Overview

Incident response is the structured process used to detect, analyze, and respond to security incidents.

An effective response helps minimize damage and restore normal operations quickly.

## What is a Security Incident

A security incident is any event that compromises the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of systems or data.

Examples include:

* Unauthorized access
* Malware infections
* Data breaches
* Service disruptions

## Incident Response Lifecycle

### 1. Preparation

Preparation involves establishing policies, procedures, and tools required to respond to incidents.

Examples:

* Incident response plans
* Security monitoring tools
* Staff training

### 2. Detection and Analysis

Security events are monitored and analyzed to determine whether they represent a real incident.

Activities include:

* Log analysis
* Alert triage
* Event correlation

### 3. Containment

The goal of containment is to limit the spread and impact of the incident.

Examples:

* Isolating compromised systems
* Blocking malicious traffic
* Disabling affected accounts

### 4. Eradication and Recovery

Once the threat is contained, the root cause is removed and systems are restored.

Typical actions:

* Removing malware
* Patching vulnerabilities
* Restoring clean backups

### 5. Post-Incident Review

After resolving the incident, organizations analyze what happened and improve defenses.

This stage may include:

* Updating policies
* Improving monitoring
* Training staff

A structured incident response process significantly improves organizational resilience.
